  "content": "One of the most common responses I get from people about CoderNotes is that they aren't sure how it can be best used.  Since I personally find that my productivity skyrockets when using CoderNotes, I decided to write a blog post talking about what it's like to add CoderNotes into your workflow, using my actual development session's notes from this past Friday.  We'll be going back through my notes from that day (where I spent ~8 hours getting CoderNotes ready for Alpha), and let's see how I used it, and what value it provided.\n\n## Note #1: Weird or Troublesome Syntax\n\nTo put some context for this one, I was looking to grab some data from my backend's GraphQL endpoint. However, I was dealing with a migration issue after having implemented Algolia. Because of this, I wanted to completely delete a property off of the incoming object if the \"objectID\" column was null or empty. \n\nLike the above, this one took a google search result to find. However, this is really awkward syntax, which uses a reserved keyword in the javascript language itself. Even though this is easily google-able, I knew I wanted to include it in my CoderNotes for future reference. \n\n![Screenshot of code snippet](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/PumOHaiyBSvPcNhN.png)\n\n*(Note: The UI is undergoing a major redesign in March as I get CoderNotes ready for Beta - expect these to look much nicer when you use the app!)*\n\nImagine that, like me, you had to look this up. What steps are involved in a simple google search?\n\n1. Open up a new tab\n2. Consider the right way to word it for Google\n3. Look at the top three links, how many are ads?\n4. Find the non-ad one that seems like the best fit\n5. Look through the page, where is the one line that you need from the website?\n6. Copy that, paste, and close the new tab\n7. Repeat if you ever need to look this up again\n\n**Although it only takes a few seconds, it's enough of a task for the brain to engage in task-switching. We're no longer in writing code mode, we're in google search mode.** \n\nSince this code snippet is something that has tripped me up in the past, I decided to add it to CoderNotes. What does searching look like in CoderNotes?\n\n![Gif of searching code in CoderNotes](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/IObjkoRDZJNHgKLT.gif)\n\nThe nice thing about having this in CoderNotes is that search is really smart for awkward syntax like this. Check out the different ways I can search for this snippet below:\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/QLpPqnLSTrEBdxTe.gif)\n\n*\"delete\"*\n\n*\"remove\"*\n\n*\"key javascript\"*\n\n*\"object delete\"*\n\n**This is one of the most powerful feature of CoderNotes.** We want to be able to save a tricky code snippet, sure, but that's worthless if you can't get back to it. CoderNotes searches the title, comments, url, and even the code itself to identify exactly what you're looking for.\n\n## Note #2: Difficult Exceptions\n\nAlthough sometimes it can be very easy to determine the root cause of an exception, it's often super difficult. It's frustrating because, while you know you can't be the first person to come across this problem, it can take hours to find the solution to your problem above the noise. That's exactly what happened to me, and I'll show you why CoderNotes helps in the long-term.\n\nContext: I did a dumb thing of implementing Algolia and refactoring at the same time. Once I was finished, I was getting the following error:\n\n```\nUncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined\n```\n\nMy first step was to copy-paste the exception into Google.\n\n### Search error on Google\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/ANTRjzjJsIoIhkpn.png)\n\nI went through each of these to figure out what might be wrong. The first result was talking about technology very different from my own (electron-vue vs svelte), but I decided to take a look. Despite having multiple possible solutions on the page, none of which seemed to apply to me. \n\nThe second result I looked at used Angular 6, which I wasn't using, but it was also about Algolia, which is the technology I had just implemented. \n\nPerhaps my refactoring was correct after all, and this is an Algolia issue?\n\nThe problem is, the solution here mentions a polyfill.ts file. I definitely don't have something like that. So, I'll keep Algolia in mind, but I need to keep searching.\n\n**Unfortunately, the rest of google's first page wasn't relevant to me either!** Worse, these all started taking me down the wrong different rabbit holes, thinking that something was wrong with my bundler, or missing a plugin, etc. \n\nHowever, this wasn't the case at all.\n\n### 30 minutes later\n\nAfter spending wayy too long searching, I finally found this github about.md\n\nBy the way, this does not show up when you search for \"Algolia Svelte <error message>\". I don't even remember how I found it.\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/ZibkUQDCoFSgWxPn.png)\n\nDid you catch the solution in that mess of a page?\n\n> \"The Algolia client makes a reference to 'process', which does not exist in the browser. Add the code below to prevent errors\"\n\n***Finally.***\n\nAfter finding this, I made sure to immediately store this in CoderNotes. If I ever see this error again, I want the answer to show up instantly.\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/jAEPvSrZkzscShdR.png)\n\nLook at all the great information we now have:\n\n1. Searching for error finds exact match\n2. Instant line of code for plug-and-play solution\n3. A comment that not only give context to the error message, but is also searchable, which allows this snippet to be found in other, creative ways:\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/gxnTMKERCbSLsmek.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/XYEqupXDHHXAMzIb.png)\n\nThis leads into the best feature of CoderNotes: **Public sharing of notes.**\n\nBy default, notes are shared publicly with everyone. That means, just by making this note for myself, I have potentially helped every other svelte / algolia developer out there. We have the ability to solve the problem once, and retrieve it forever.\n\nIn contrast, StackOverflow only has results to find when people are asking the question. I don't know about you, but I rarely post to SO, even if I've been stuck for a day. My ratio of learning something worth sharing vs asking the question on SO is like 10000:1. If that's true for other developers, why haven't we developed a system that creates an incentive to cache that knowledge as we learn, as opposed to when we want to post on Stack Overflow?\n\n**Because people are more likely to save a snippet for their own reference, CoderNotes builds a much higher level of content than StackOverflow, especially around difficult or rare error messages.**\n\nOf course, CoderNotes does allow for different levels of privacy, depending on the plan you're on. A paid user can write unlimited private notes, which is important when you want to create notes that store any secret information. Additionally, the \"Team\" plan allows teams to have notes that they share amongst themselves, but are hidden from the rest of the world. This is perfect for teams that want a collaborative space for common roadblocks, but are unwilling or uncomfortable with having those notes public.\n\n## Final Note: References\n\nThis snippet isn't actually from the coding session I've been talking about above, but I want to show you why I decided to call this CoderNotes and not CoderSnippets:\n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/kytMWZTvFwPRgxdP.gif)\n\nSince CoderNotes has a great search engine, it's not just limited to your code. If you find a great article that you would like to reference later, CoderNotes is exactly the place for it.\n\nHave you ever found a great tutorial or technical guide, but couldn't find it later? By storing it in CoderNotes, we can save that article and make it easy to find later. No more searching google, or trying to remember who published the article (Medium? Personal blog? Slack group?) and tracking it down in history.\n\nI've personally been shocked with how often I use this feature, and how many times it saves me from forgetting some small detail of an implementation.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nHopefully you've gotten a good idea of how I use CoderNotes for both simple, everyday google queries, to complex error messages and links. In addition, I hope you can see how useful this would be for teams.\n\nIf CoderNotes interests you, registration for the beta is currently available at codernotes.io!
