Since I personally find that my productivity skyrockets when using CoderNotes, I decided to write a blog post talking about what it's like to add CoderNotes into your workflow, using my actual development session's notes from this past Friday. \nWe'll be going back through my notes from that day (where I spent ~8 hours getting CoderNotes ready for Alpha), and let's see how I used it, and what value it provided.\n\n\n\n## Note #1: Weird or Troublesome Syntax\n\nTo put some context for this one, I was looking to grab some data from my backend's GraphQL endpoint. However, I was dealing with a migration issue after having implemented Algolia. Because of this, I wanted to completely delete a property off of the incoming object if the \"objectID\" column was null or empty. \n\n\n\nLike the above, this one took a google search result to find. However, this is really awkward syntax, which uses a reserved keyword in the javascript language itself. Even though this is easily google-able, I knew I wanted to include it in my CoderNotes for future reference. \n\n![](https://landen.imgix.net/blog_zcbvTDNHiuapQvtt/assets/PumOHaiyBSvPcNhN.png)",
